## Why?

My employer organized a Hackathon, where I had the opportunity to create something unrelated to work, so I decided to put together a Snake game with sound effects indicating the snake's current position (so that the game can also be played by visually impaired or without looking at the screen).

## Current state

The game works more or less currently. If you encounter a bug or have an improvement suggestion, open an issue.

## Goals

- to improve sound feedback of the current position of the snake (for more accuracy)
- add highscore table
- improve timing accuracy for better sound
- increase pleasantness of game sounds
